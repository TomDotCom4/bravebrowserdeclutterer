Works as of whatever Brave version is current on 16/02/2021

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Fullscreen your Brave Profile on the "welcome screen"
2. Hit F10 to run it.
3. Ensure that your display is set to 1080p and scaled to 100% and that your Windows taskbar is pinned at the bottom of the screen while your Brave Browser is fullscreened before starting the script.
